1. Workout Sessions Table Structure
Every time a user performs a workout, log a session with:

Field	Description
PK	USER#<sub>
SK	WORKOUT_SESSION#<date>#<uuid>
WorkoutId	ID of the workout performed
WorkoutName	Name of the workout
Date	ISO date from user's device
Notes	Optional notes (e.g., "felt strong")
GSI1PK	USER#<sub>
GSI1SK	DATE#<date>#<timestamp>
2. Exercise Performance Logs
Each session has multiple performed exercises, like:

Field	Description
PK	USER#<sub>
SK	WORKOUT_SESSION#<date>#<uuid>#EXERCISE#<uuid>
ExerciseName	e.g., "Bench Press"
SetsPerformed	[{ set: 1, reps: 10, weight: 135 }, ...]
WorkoutId	Links to definition
WorkoutSessionId	Link to parent session

3. Session Ingestion
Your frontend would:

Choose a workout from the definitions

Render each exercise and allow the user to log sets, reps, weight

Submit the full session to a POST /workout-tracking endpoint

Storage Plan:
DynamoDB table WorkoutSessions:

PK: USER#<sub>

SK: WORKOUT_SESSION#<date>#<uuid> (parent)

SK: WORKOUT_SESSION#<date>#<uuid>#EXERCISE#<uuid> (children)

Use GSI1 for querying by date across sessions.

 Bonus

Track volume (reps × weight) per exercise

Calculate progress over time (e.g. PR tracker)

Store perceived exertion (RPE) if you're feeling elite

Add missed sets or notes per set if you want fine granularity

Concept Breakdown
You're tracking actual completed workouts, not just definitions. Think:
“What did I lift on August 7th, 2025?”

My structure already supports:

✅ Per-user tracking
✅ Per-date session logging
✅ Exercise details like weight, reps, volume, notes, RPE, and missed sets
✅ Queryable by date via GSI



Sample POST Payload to /workout-tracking
{
  "workoutId": "abc123",
  "workoutName": "Chest Day",
  "date": "2025-08-07",
  "notes": "Felt strong. Bench PR.",
  "exercises": [
    {
      "exerciseName": "Flat Bench Press",
      "setsPerformed": [
        { "set": 1, "reps": 10, "weight": 185 },
        { "set": 2, "reps": 8, "weight": 195 },
        { "set": 3, "reps": 6, "weight": 205 }
      ],
      "rpe": 9,
      "missedSets": 0,
      "notes": "Last set was tough"
    },
    {
      "exerciseName": "Incline DB Bench Press",
      "setsPerformed": [
        { "set": 1, "reps": 10, "weight": 60 },
        { "set": 2, "reps": 10, "weight": 65 },
        { "set": 3, "reps": 8, "weight": 70 }
      ],
      "rpe": 8,
      "missedSets": 0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}



What This Actually Stores
Primary Record:




PK: USER#your-sub-id




SK: WORKOUT_SESSION#2025-08-07#<UUID>

Contains: workoutId, workoutName, date, timestamp, notes, GSI1 for queries




2️⃣ For each Exercise:



PK: same




SK: WORKOUT_SESSION#2025-08-07#<UUID>#EXERCISE#<exercise-uuid>

Includes: name, sets, volume, notes, RPE, etc.





🔍 Querying Strategy

later, I can:




Use the DateIndex to fetch all sessions on a given date for a user.




Use the WorkoutId to group sessions historically.




Extend later with another GSI if you want to track by exercise name or muscle group.
